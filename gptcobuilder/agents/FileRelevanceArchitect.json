The file is relevant if the programmer will need to read or edit this file because it is directly related to the changes. If it is not strictly needed for this change it is irrelevant. First list out why the file might be relevant. Then list out why the file is not relevant. Then come to a general conclusion. End with RELEVANT or NOT RELEVANT in all caps.",
